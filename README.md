# Power_BI_Dashboards
This project presents a comprehensive Hotel Operations and Booking Performance Dashboard designed to analyze booking trends, customer behavior, and revenue efficiency. The dashboard enables hotel management to make data-driven decisions by identifying revenue leakage, operational gaps, and growth opportunities.

**🔑 Key Insights – Hotel Operations & Booking Dashboard**
1) High Revenue but Underutilized Capacity :
Despite generating 2bn in revenue, the hotel operates at only 57.87% occupancy, indicating significant unused room inventory and opportunity for growth without increasing capacity.

2) High Cancellation Rate Causes Revenue Leakage :
With 24.83% of bookings cancelled, nearly 1 in 4 confirmed bookings fails to convert into actual stays, directly impacting revenue realization and operational planning.

3) Strong Pricing Does Not Guarantee Revenue :
The hotel maintains a healthy ADR of 12.7K, but RevPAR remains moderate at 7.35K, proving that high pricing alone does not maximize revenue without strong occupancy and realization.

4) Revenue Realisation is Only 70.15% :
Only 70% of expected revenue is actually realized, highlighting losses due to cancellations, discounts, and no-shows, and signaling the need for tighter booking and pricing controls.

5) Luxury Rooms Drive Maximum Revenue :
Presidential and luxury room classes generate the highest RevPAR, showing that high-end customers deliver stronger revenue efficiency and lower booking drop-offs.

6)  Mid-Tier Rooms Underperform :
Premium and Elite rooms show weaker booking success and lower RevPAR, suggesting a pricing or value perception gap that needs repositioning.

7) Booking Conversion is a Major Bottleneck :
Only 57.87% of booking attempts are successful, indicating friction in the booking journey related to pricing, availability, or payment processes.

8) Online Platforms Dominate but Increase Dependency :
Most bookings and customer ratings come from third-party online platforms, while direct offline bookings contribute the least, increasing commission costs and dependency risk.

9) Customer Stays Are Short-Term
The average length of stay is 2.37 days, indicating dominance of short or weekend stays, which limits customer lifetime value and total revenue per booking.

10) Demand and Revenue Are Seasonally and Weekly Volatile
Bookings peak in May, decline afterward, and RevPAR fluctuates weekly even when ADR remains stable, confirming that demand variation—not pricing—is the key revenue driver.
